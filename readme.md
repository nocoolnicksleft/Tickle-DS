###Tickle for Nintendo DS

This proof-of-concept animation demo has the little fellow take a bath where he needs some assistance in setting the water temperature and getting soap and towel.

It is written in C++ using a self-contained library for framebuffer graphics animation. 

There are no plans to take this app any further.

###Remarks

The toolchain is devkitARM - although last compiled on an old version I am not able to reproduce. Hence it currently does not compile.
